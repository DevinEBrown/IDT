  <h1>Signature Assignment</h1>
  <hr>
  <h2 class="h3">Learning/Knowledge Gap</h2>
  <p>One specific learning gap that might be addressed in this course is understanding the importance of accessibility in web design. This includes ensuring that websites are usable and navigable by individuals with disabilities, such as those who use screen readers or have other accessibility needs. Learners may not be familiar with web accessibility, so incorporating this topic into the curriculum would be valuable in creating more inclusive and user-friendly websites.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p><b>Grade</b>: 9 - 12<br>
<b>Education</b>: Basic familiarity with computers and the internet, but no prior formal education in web design.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Learners in grades 9 - 12 will likely have some experience using computers and the internet for basic tasks such as browsing, social media, and school assignments. They may have some exposure to simple website navigation but are not expected to have any formal training in web design.</p>
<h2>Learning Theories</h2>
<h3>Constructivism</h3>
<p>Constructivism promotes active, hands-on learning, engaging high school students through experiential activities. Learners construct their understanding, fostering personalized approaches to learning. By linking new knowledge to prior experiences, students grasp the practical applications of what they're taught. However, constructivist methods can be time-consuming, requiring ample exploration and discovery. Despite limitations, constructivism offers valuable opportunities for student-centered, experiential learning, enhancing comprehension and real-world application in educational contexts.</p>
<h3>Connectivism</h3>
<p>Connectivism creates networked learning. It cultivates critical thinking by honing skills in source evaluation and synthesizing information, which is crucial for effective web design. Moreover, Connectivism is flexible, accommodating varied learning preferences and contexts. However, proficiency in digital literacy is imperative for students to fully capitalize on Connectivism and adeptly navigate digital tools and online resources. Furthermore, the abundance of information in the digital landscape may overwhelm learners, leading to difficulties in filtering and comprehension.</p>
<h2> Minicourse Format</h2>
<p><b>Blended Learning</b> combines online instruction with in-person activities and is well-suited for this mini-course. It allows for a balance between structured online lessons and interactive in-person activities. Given that the target audience is in grades 9 -12, a blended approach recognizes their familiarity with digital tools while providing valuable face-to-face interactions for discussions, collaboration, and hands-on assistance. This modality ensures that learners can access course materials conveniently while still benefiting from the social and collaborative aspects of in-person learning.</p>
