<p>Lesson</p>
<h3>Understanding Typography in Web Design</h3>
<h4>Learning Activities</h4>

<p><b>Activity 1</b>: Introduction<br>
This activity is lecture focused and will begin with a brief discussion on the importance of visual appeal in web design and how typography plays a crucial role.
The lecture will define typography and emphasize that it involves selecting typefaces, classification, hierarchy, font sizes, line lengths, and other design elements to convey a specific message. We will also discuss the impact of typography on user experience and how it can influence the perception of a website.<br>
<i>aligns to module learning outcome (MLO) (1, 2, 3)</i></p>

<p><b>Activity 2</b>: Typography Exploration<br>
In small groups, students will explore the website. They will analyze the typography used on these websites. Groups will take note of the typefaces, font sizes, line spacing, and any other typographic elements that stand out to them. After exploration, each group presents their findings, discussing how the typography contributes to the overall design and user experience.<br>
<i>aligns to module learning outcome (MLO) (1, 2, 3)</i></p>

<h4>Assessment Strategies</h4>  
<p><b>Assessment 1</b>: Interactive Quiz<br>
This interactive quiz will assess students' understanding of key typography concepts, including the definition of typography, the impact of typography on user experience, and the terminology associated with typography (e.g., serif, sans-serif, leading, kerning).<br>
<i>aligns to module learning outcome (MLO) (1, 2)</i></p>

<p><b>Assessment 2</b>: Typography in Action Assignment<br>
In this assignment, students will create a simple webpage with typography. Students will experiment with different typefaces, hierarchies, font sizes, and colors to convey moods or messages. Students will also present and discuss the impact of their typographic choices on the overall design and message of their typography webpage.<br>

<h3>Instructional Design Model</h3>
<p> Using the Successive Approximation Model (SAM) for the minicourse is strategic due to its iterative and agile nature. SAM allows for continuous refinement, prototyping, and collaboration, aligning seamlessly with the dynamic nature of web design. The development process becomes responsive to learner feedback by employing SAM, ensuring that the course content evolves iteratively. This approach enables the creation of early prototypes, fostering hands-on, practical learning experiences for high school students. SAM's emphasis on formative assessment and real-world application ensures the minicourse remains engaging, effective, and tailored to the evolving needs of the target audience.</p>
<p>As a UX designer, SAM is a beneficial approach because it emphasizes iterative prototyping and user feedback throughout the design process, allowing for continuous refinement and adaptation to learner needs, resulting in a more student-centric final course.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Learning Theory</h3>
<p>The learning theories best used in this course are Constructivism and Connectivism. Constructivism emphasizes active learning through hands-on experiences. Collaborative web design projects, design critiques, and problem-solving scenarios engage students, fostering a deeper understanding of web design principles. Connectivism views learning as network-distributed, emphasizing technology and social connections. Activities like collaborative online tools, peer reviews, and web accessibility audits leverage digital platforms, encouraging students to tap into online resources for a networked and socially connected learning experience.</p>
